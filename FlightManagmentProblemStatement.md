Problem Statement:
Design an application for flight inventory and booking management systems. Where every day multiple flights are flying on different sectors and flights can have multiple fares and for each fare there will be a list of seats.
Assumptions:

There is a supplier that is providing flight data.
Flights can have multiple fare Type and for each fare Type airline is providing an available seat list.
If a seat is already booked, other users can't book the same seat.
Take today's date as 1.
For departDate simple number is provided like - 1, 2, 3, 4, etc
For time, assume its 24 hour format and will be a decimal number.
User fund will be a decimal number only.
Features:

AddUser(userld, name, funds)
Return user details
Output:- <u1, name, funds>
SearchFlight(from, to, departDate, paxCount)
Return available flights for given request in below format. (for the same date and if all available seats are equal or more than provided pax count).
Output:- <flightNumber, airline, from, to, departDate, depart Time, price, fare Type, List< seat >>
Book flight(userld, from, to, flightNumber, departDate, fareType, list< seat>)
Book flight if all seats are available with the same fareType and the user has enough funds in his/her wallet. Deduct funds from userAccount for booking and return bookingld.
If it fails, then return a proper error message.
##Bonus Question

SearchFlightByPreferedAirline(from, to, departDate, paxCount, preferredAirline, sortBy, SortType)
Return available flights for given request in below format
Output:- <flightNumber, airline, from, to, departDate, depart Time, price, List< seat>>
Create entities and service classes such that if new requirements come code will be extensible.

Commands(Test cases):
AddUser(userld, name, funds)
ADDUSER u1 Vinit 5000
ADDUSER u2 Neha 1500
SearchFlightfrom, to, departDate, paxCount)
SEARCHFLIGHT DEL BLR 2 1
SEARCHFLIGHT DEL BLR 22
SEARCHFLIGHT DEL HYD 2 22
Book flight(userld, from, to, flightNumber, airline, departDate, fare Type, list< seat>)
BOOK u1, DEL, BOM, 111, 6e, 2, F1, 10a, 11c, 20b
BOOK u1, DEL, BOM, 211, 6e, 2, F2, 10a, 11c, 20b
BOOK u2, DEL, BOM, 141, 6e, 2, F4, 32e
SearchFlight(from, to, departDate, paxCount, preferredAirline, sortBy, SortType)
SEARCHFLIGHT DEL, BLR, 2, 1, AI, PRICE, DESC
Guidelines:

Do not implement user/admin authentication
Input can be read from a file or STDIN or coded in a driver method.
Output can be written to a file or STDOUT.
Feel free to store all interim/output data in-memory.
Restrict internet usage to looking up syntax
You are free to use the language of your choice.
Save your code/project by your name and email it. Your program will be executed on another machine. So, explicitly specify dependencies, if any, in your email.
Expectation

Code should be Demo-able and functionally complete.
Code should fail gracefully with a proper error message for corner/invalid cases, use exceptions for handling these cases.
Code should be modular, try thinking in terms of Object-Oriented Design.
Input can be taken from the command line or in the main function.
Do not use any database or NoSQL store, use in-memory data structure.
Do not create any Ul for the application
Driver class can be designed as per your choice, but it should cover all the scenarios. : Optional Implement unit test
